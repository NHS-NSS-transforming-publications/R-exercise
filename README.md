# R-exercise

This exercise will be given to analysts interested in creating a [Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf) by [TPP](https://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/Transforming-Publishing-Programme/). It is designed to give a rough indication of a person's experience with R.

The data used in this exercise are a populations file split by council area, year, age and sex (downloaded from the [NRS website](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/)) and a council area name/code lookup file. The exercise is focused predominantly on manipulations carried out on the populations file.

Code and comments are provided for section 1. The comments for sections 2 and 3 (plus a small piece of code for section 3) are provided; space is provided to fill in the code. We recommend using the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/) of coding and piping (`%>%`) each part of section 3 together. We encourage using [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), R help files (accessible by typing `?function_name` into the RStudio console) and any other suitable resources which aid the process of completing this exercise and using R in general.
