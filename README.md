# R-exercise

This exercise will be given to teams interested in creating a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) by TPP. In the absence of a team having a small, suitable piece of past work in R (such as an information request) to give to TPP, this exercise is designed to give a rough indication of a team's experience with R.

The data used in this exercise are a populations file split by council area, year, age and sex (downloaded from the [NRS website](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/)) and a council area name/code lookup file. The exercise is focused predominantly on manipulations carried out on the populations file.

Code and comments are provided for section 1. The comments for sections 2 and 3 are provided; space is provided to fill in the code. We would recommend using the tidyverse style of coding and piping (`%>%`) each part of section 3 together.
